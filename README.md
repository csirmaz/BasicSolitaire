I uploaded this old project as it contains an algorithm to play classic solitaire
that might be interesting, although the code is a bit messy.

Download the compiled version
[here](http://www.epcsirmaz.com/solit.exe) -
you can use [DosBox](http://www.dosbox.com/) to run it.

Read the documentation in the [wiki](https://github.com/csirmaz/BasicSolitaire/wiki).
